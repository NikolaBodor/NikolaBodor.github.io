  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

  <h2>Simple Problem</h2>
  <p>
    My simply solved problem was in the Javascript Kata in which I was completing the SuperFlipFlop section which needed to check every number in the array if it was divisible by 3, 5 and 15 and swap the number for either Flip, Flop or FlipFlop. I had done everything right except for the order of the operations, I had put the line of code which checks for if the number is divisible by 3, 5 then 15 which would mean that numbers like 30 would just be swapped for Flip instead of FlipFlop but then I realised why it wasn't passing the tests and fixed it. From this problem I learnt I needed to read the instructions and my code more thoroughly.

  <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving Techniques/Processes</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>Pseudocode: I'm kinda confident with it but I still need to get more used to using it..</li>
    <li>Trying something: I'm pretty confident with this.</li>
    <li>Rubber ducky method: I am really confident with this method except I just use one of my parents and most of the time realise what I needed before I finish explaining to them my problems.</li>
    <li>Reading error messages: I'm pretty confident with reading error messages.</li>
    <li>Console.logging: I'm very confident with console logging, I think its very useful.</li>
    <li>Googling: I'm very confident with googling since I've been brought up on google I can find what I'm looking for 8/10 times and documentation is very helpful.</li>
    <li>Asking my peers for help: I'm kinda that confident with using this method because I can but I don't know anyone yet and it feels a bit awkward to just ask.</li>
    <li>Asking my coaches for help: I'm not that confident with using this method because I'm usually a bit behind and feel like it's bad to ask for help when I should be doing other things.</li>
