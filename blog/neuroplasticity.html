  <h2>AGES Learning Model</h2>
  <p>
    The AGES learning model has four components, attention, generation, emotion and spacing. 
    <ul>
    <li>The attention component suggests that to properly learn you need to grab and hold the attention of whoever is learning.</li>
    <li>The generation component suggests that to help with learning you need to actively connect new concepts with what you already know to solidfy you understanding of the new concepts.</li>
    <li>The emotion component suggests that emotions can significantly influence memory. Positive emotional states can boost your memory and learning while negative emotional states can delay and set you back.</li>
    <li>The spacing component suggests that learning isn't a one time event and that it requires multiple sessions over time for the information to become permanent.</li>
    </ul>
    By understanding these four component, poeple can put them into practice and learn more effectively.
