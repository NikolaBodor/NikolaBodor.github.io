    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
   
    <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
    <p>
      I find Dev Acadamy interesting and programing fun, but my career pathway depends on wether I get a job after this course or decide to study something else in university.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills I'd like to develop while at Dev Acadamy</h2>
    <p>
      One skill I would like to develop while at Dev Acadamy is being able to write without overthinking and being very unsure of what I'm going to write, like with these blogs. Another skill I would like to develop is to ask for help from my peers or facilitators when I am struggling.
    </p>

    <h2>Workload Commitments</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>I will work productively and safely with others by being fair and letting them voice their opinions in disscusstions and give constructive feedback.</li>
      <li>When things are building up and starting to get stressful for me I will take a break with a walk and have some water and food.</li>
    </p></ul>

    <h2>Seeking Help</h2>
    <p>
      I'll seek help by contacting my peers or facilitators on discord via the channel #foundations-help-desk or direct messages.
    </p>

    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      My expectations for the facilitation team are for them to explain things and answer my questions, respect and patience.
