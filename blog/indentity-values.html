    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <h2 class="seperator">15/09/25</h2>

    <h2>Ethical decision</h2>
    <p>
      A couple years back me and a friend found a job delivering flyers fortnightly for a real estate company in the school notices, we decided wanted to apply and do that together. After a few deliveries my friend decided he didn't want to continue but I felt like I shouldn't quit and felt like I was commited and responsible for that job. And so for serevral months until the summer holidays I continued delivering the flyers.

    <h2>My values and identity</h2>
    <p>
      My family is from Eastern Europe, the values I get from them are direct and simple communication (bluntness) and honesty among other values like responsibility and dependability. My family and culture has lead me to believe in these values and apply them to each and every thing I do. I pride myself in being sticking to these values.
    </p>

    <h2>My strengths</h2>
    <p>
      Some of my strengths are curiosity and problem solving. Curiosity will help me learn a lot and dig deeper for meanings, principles, 
      how things work and why they work. Problem solving will be a really useful strength for programming since it's mainly about solving problems so 
      it's a perfect match.
    </p>

    <h2>My Limitations and Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>
      Some of my limitations and weaknesses are writing, my focus and pushing myself to start on less intresting portions of work. I have always struggled to write alot in school and even now during the blog and human skills portion while doing well on the technical side. Hopefully during this course or by the end of it, I can improve on this weakness. Pushing myself is alos a big limitation for me espically when the work is not as intresting or is long and tedious. This could really affect my workout put during this course but my goal is to try force myself in small bits of work to just get everything done, the fun and intresting sections and also the less intresting sections. My focus is also a limitation and a weakness but less than the other two, sometimes I get distracted by something small and then find it hard to refocus back onto my task at hand.

    <h2> Team situations</h2>
      <p>
        I haven't really had many opportunities to be in such situations.
