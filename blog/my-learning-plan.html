  <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
  <h2 class="seperator">5/10/25</h2>
  
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size: 30pt;">Bootcamp Learning Plan:</h3>
  <h2>My Long Term Goal</h2>
  <p>
    My long term goal is to find a job in backend development.
  </p>

  <h2>My Biggest Strengths and Mimitations in Bootcamp?</h2>
  <p>
    I still think my biggest strengths are going to be my curiosity and problem solving coupled with me already enjoying this course. These will be very useful because there will be a lot to learn and even if I feel overwhelmed I'll be enjoying it and wanting to learn more.
  </p>
  <p>
    My limitations are a lot the same, the lack of focus I have at times will be annoying to deal with but I just need to set up an enviroment and schedule which forces me to be surrounded by less distractions and interuptions.
  </p>

  <h2>My Biggest Non-Technical Challenge in Bootcamp will be</h2>
  <p>
    One of my biggest non-technical challenges will be working on and staying focused bootcamp for 9 weeks straight will be a challenge but im hoping ill be intrested enough for it not to matter. Another non technical challenge will be working in a group, I don't think it'll be a big challenge but I feel like i might struggle a bit.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Technical Skills(Human Skills) I would like to see Developed in Myself while at Dev Academy</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>Asking for help if I need it (not sure if it counts as a human skills).</li>
    <li>Improving my self reflection skills and just self reflection in general.</li>
    <li>Developing some leadership skills.</li>
    <li>Giving feedback, I'm good with receiving feedback but I lack in giving it out.</li>
  </p></ul>

  <h2>My Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</h2>
  <p>
    My expectations of the bootcamp team are for everyone to be respectful towards me and the rest of the learners and for them to be patient with us.
  </p>

  <h2>What are My Expectations of Myself at Bootcamp</h2>
  <p>
    I will seek help after a day if I am still struggling on the same thing since everything is fast paced I shouldn't wait too long. I will manage the workload by spending my day 9-5 plus how much ever time I need until i have finished the work for that day(if it gets too late I'll continue on the weekend on the next day). I will manage myself to make sure I work productively by setting times where I'm only working and have no distractions during the day. I will work safely with others no matter if they are learners or facilitators by being respectful to everyone while activly listening to everything they have to say and adding in my own comments/questions/suggestions(if needed).
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30pt;">Foundations Learning Plan:</h2>
  <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
  <p>
    I find Dev Acadamy interesting and programing fun, but my career pathway depends on whether I get a job after this course or decide to study something else in university.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills I'd like to develop while at Dev Acadamy</h2>
  <p>
    One skill I would like to develop while at Dev Acadamy is being able to write without overthinking and being very unsure of what I'm going to write, like with these blogs. Another skill I would like to develop is to ask for help from my peers or facilitators when I am struggling.
  </p>

  <h2>Workload Commitments</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>I will work productively and safely with others by being fair and letting them voice their opinions in disscusstions and give constructive feedback.</li>
    <li>When things are building up and starting to get stressful for me I will take a break with a walk and have some water and food.</li>
  </p></ul>

  <h2>Seeking Help</h2>
  <p>
    I'll seek help by contacting my peers or facilitators on discord via the channel #foundations-help-desk or direct messages.
  </p>

  <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
  <p>
    My expectations for the facilitation team are for them to explain things and answer my questions, respect and patience.
