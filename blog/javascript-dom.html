    <h1>Javascript & DOM</h1><h2 class="seperator">15/09/25</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Javascripts Relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>HMTL is for content e.g text, sturucture and media.</li>
      <li>CSS is for styling, colours fonts borders sizes spacing. It's the look and feel (theme/design) of a website.</li>
      <li>Javascript is for the behaviour of a website, reacts to users</li>
      <li>They all together allow the coder of the website to make it dynamic.</li>
    </p></ul>
    <h2>Loops and Control Flow</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>the flow of execution is if statments and Loops</li>
      <li>If, else statments are like railroad switches, if something doesnt meet the condition of the if statment it falls back to the else part.</li>
      <br>

      <br>
      <pre>if (meets condition) {
        does this
      } else {
        does this
      }
      </pre>
      <img style="width: 700px;" src="../images/Funzionamento_Deviatoio.gif" alt="animated gif of a birds eye view train switch switching tracks"/>
      <li>Loops are like a game of Monopoly. You throw the dice and go from square to square until you reach back where you started and then go again.</li>
      <br>

    <h2>DOM</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>The DOM is structured like a tree where each branches only has one parent.</li>
      <br>

      <br>
      <li>starts at the top of the tree and find which element you are calling by id or class or smt and looks through branchs to find it</li>
    </p></ul>

    <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>access arrays from numerical value</li>
      <li>acess objects from property names</li>
    </p></ul>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Functions are ways to spilt up code and oraganise it, this makes it easier for someone trying to read the code and makes it easier for you</li>
      <li>helpful because makes it easier to read and not mix up code</li>
      <li>write the code once then call (can call it mnultiple times) it so you dont have to write it multiple times</li>
    </p></ul>
