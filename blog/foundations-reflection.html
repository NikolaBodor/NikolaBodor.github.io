  <h2>Three Things I Learnt About Myself During Human Skills</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <li>One thing I learnt about EQ and it's importance in the workspace and daily life.</li>
    <li>Another thing I learnt having a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset can be the difference between day and night.</li>
    <li>A third thing I learnt how useful and used listening and looping is in the workplace.</li>
  </p></ol>

  <h2>The Roles of Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming?</h2>
  <p>The role of values in learning is to help with giving you a purpose and in turn more motivation to learn and explore new things, in programming is to help you write ethical and useful code making sure it's used for it's intended purpose.</p>
  <p>The role of empathy in programming and learning is that it improves collaboration with your peers and helps you communicate and understand them better. Empathy also helps you programme solutions which will solve the issue because you'll understand their needs and limitations</p>
  <p>The role of self self-awareness in programming and learning is to help with improving yourself and your abilities in programming and learning, it shows your weaknesses, strengths and helps with identifying good learning methods for you and with setting goals and asking for help when needed. Self-awareness also helps to realise when you have reached your limitations and helps you manage your time and stress better.</p>

  <h2>Something that has Surprised Me in the Human Skills Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Something that has surprised me in the human skills learning is how important it actually is in the programming industry and also other industries, and how interviewers actively look for it in people. Another thing that has surprised me is the extent that Dev Academy is going to teach us about it, but it makes sense now.

  <h2>What were the Most Challenging Aspects of the Human Skills Learning?</h2>
  <p>
    The most challenging part of human skills was figuring out what to write in these blogs and how to write it effectively.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do I think Dev Academy is Spending So Much Time Focusing on Human Skills Learning in a Web Development Bootcamp Course?</h2>
  <p>
    I think Dev Academy is spending this much time focusing on human skills is because they realise the importance of the human skills and how not many people yet realise how big of an impact it makes in everyday life as well as in the industry, like me for example who had no idea it was important until we started learning about it.
  </p>

  <h2>Does the Time I Spent Studying Human Skills Learning at Dev Academy feel like a Waste of Time? Should I have just Used that Time to Practise Programming Instead?</h2>
  <p>
    Learning about human skills isn't a waste of time in my opinion but writing the blogs(both human skills blogs and technical blogs) feels kind of like a waste of time because I get caught up in it and spend more time overthinking what I have to write rather than writing it and being done with the blogs. I don't think I should've just used that time practising programming instead but I feel like some of the time I could've spent on programming rather than the human skills (not all).
